          <span class="font-extrabold">FOLDS</span> is a student folder
          management system developed specifically for College-Based
          Organizations at Palawan State University (PalSU). It is designed to
          monitor student folders, particularly during enrollment periods.
          Typically, students borrow their folders from their respective
          organization offices to complete their enrollment process. These
          folders are then processed in the encoding room and may be returned,
          left unreturned, or occasionally lost. This system is a simplified
          web-based version of the original

          functionality (TO KEEP TRACK OF FOLDERS).
