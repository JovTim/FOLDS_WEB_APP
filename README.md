# FOLDS - Folder Tracking System

FOLDS is a student folder management system developed specifically for College-Based Organizations at Palawan State University (PalSU). It is designed to monitor student folders, particularly during enrollment periods. Typically, students borrow their folders from their respective organization offices to complete their enrollment process. These folders are then processed in the encoding room and may be returned, left unreturned, or occasionally lost. This system is a simplified web-based version of the original FOLDS System, offering a more minimal approach while retaining its core functionality (TO KEEP TRACK OF FOLDERS).
